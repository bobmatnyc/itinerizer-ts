# AI Trip Designer

The AI Trip Designer is your intelligent travel planning companion. It helps you create, refine, and optimize your itineraries through natural conversation.

## Starting a Conversation

1. **Select an itinerary** from the sidebar
2. **Click the chat bubble** or use the chat panel at the bottom
3. **Describe your trip**: Tell the AI about your travel plans

### Example Prompts

**Planning a new trip:**
- "I want to plan a 5-day trip to Tokyo for my family in April"
- "Help me create a romantic weekend getaway to Paris"
- "Plan an adventure trip to Costa Rica for solo travel"

**Refining your itinerary:**
- "Add a cooking class on day 3"
- "Find a highly-rated restaurant near our hotel for dinner"
- "Move the museum visit to the morning when it's less crowded"

**Getting recommendations:**
- "What are the best neighborhoods to stay in Barcelona?"
- "Suggest activities for a rainy day in London"
- "What local food should we try in Thailand?"

## What the AI Can Do

### Create Itineraries
- Build day-by-day schedules
- Suggest activities based on your interests
- Recommend accommodations and restaurants
- Plan transportation between locations

### Search for Information
- Find current prices and availability
- Look up opening hours and locations
- Research local events and festivals
- Get weather forecasts for your dates

### Optimize Your Plans
- Balance activities with rest time
- Group nearby attractions together
- Consider travel times between locations
- Adjust for different traveler needs

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Plan a trip to Italy"
Try: "Plan a 10-day trip to Italy focusing on art and history, moderate budget, for a couple in their 30s"

### Provide Context
- Mention mobility limitations
- Specify dietary requirements
- Note if traveling with children or elderly
- Share your travel style (fast-paced vs. relaxed)

### Iterate and Refine
- Start with a general outline
- Ask for specific changes
- Request alternatives if something doesn't fit
- Fine-tune timing and logistics

## Switching to Trip Designer

When you're chatting and mention wanting to build an itinerary, the AI will automatically switch to the Trip Designer mode to help you plan. You can also explicitly ask:
- "Switch to trip planning mode"
- "Help me build this itinerary"
- "Start designing my trip"
