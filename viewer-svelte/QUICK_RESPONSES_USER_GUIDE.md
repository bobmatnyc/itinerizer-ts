# Quick Response Buttons - User Guide

## What are Quick Response Buttons?

When chatting with the Trip Designer, you'll now see **clickable suggestion buttons** below questions from the AI. These let you respond quickly without typing.

## When do they appear?

Quick response buttons appear when:
- ✅ The AI asks you a question (ending with "?")
- ✅ You're viewing the most recent message
- ✅ There are no structured questions (like date pickers or city selectors)

They **don't** appear when:
- ❌ The AI makes a statement (no question)
- ❌ Structured questions are shown instead
- ❌ The AI is still typing (streaming)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Follow-up after adding activities
```
AI: "I've added these activities to your trip. Is there
     anything else you'd like me to add?"

[Yes, add more] [I'm satisfied]
```

**Tip:** Click "Yes, add more" to continue, or "I'm satisfied" to move on.

---

### Scenario 2: Getting more information
```
AI: "Here's a walking tour of the historic district. Would
     you like more details about the route?"

[Yes, more details] [I'm good]
```

**Tip:** Click "Yes, more details" if you want to learn more.

---

### Scenario 3: Booking assistance
```
AI: "Would you like me to help you book these hotels?"

[Yes, help me] [No, just planning]
```

**Tip:** Click "No, just planning" if you're still deciding.

---

### Scenario 4: Specific actions
```
AI: "Would you like me to elaborate on these restaurants
     or help you book reservations?"

[Elaborate on restaurants] [Help book reservations]
[Yes, please] [No thanks]
```

**Tip:** Notice how the AI's specific options become individual buttons!

## How to use them

### Method 1: Click a button (recommended)
1. Read the AI's question
2. Click the button that matches your answer
3. Your response sends automatically

### Method 2: Type your own answer
1. Ignore the quick response buttons
2. Type your own response in the input field

**You can always type your own response!** Quick responses are just shortcuts.
