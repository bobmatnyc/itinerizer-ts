## Planning Effectively

### Start with the Big Picture
1. Define your trip dates and destination
2. Identify must-see attractions or activities
3. Let the AI fill in with recommendations
4. Refine based on your preferences

### Balance Your Days

## Working with AI

### Effective Prompting
**Good prompts include:**
- Specific dates and duration
- Number and type of travelers
- Budget range (budget, moderate, luxury)
- Interests and preferences
- Any constraints or requirements

**Example:**
"Plan a 7-day trip to Japan for a couple interested in food, temples, and nature. We have a moderate budget and prefer staying in boutique hotels. One of us has mild mobility issues, so avoid anything too strenuous."

2. Review and identify what to change
