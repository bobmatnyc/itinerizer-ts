INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Research what makes an excellent AI-powered Trip Designer agent for travel planning. I need comprehensive findings on:

## 1. Trip Designer vs Travel Agent Distinction
- What differentiates a "trip designer" (qualitative, experiential planning) from a "travel agent" (transactional booking)?
- What value does a trip designer provide in the planning process?

## 2. Essential Questions to Ask Users
Research the key questions trip designers ask to understand:
- **Trip basics**: Dates, duration, flexibility
- **Travelers**: Number of people, ages, relationships, special needs
- **Budget**: Total budget, luxury level, where to splurge vs save
- **Travel style**: Adventure, relaxation, cultural, food-focused, photography, etc.
- **Pace preferences**: Packed itinerary vs leisurely, downtime needs
- **Accommodation preferences**: Hotels, boutique, Airbnb, unique stays
- **Transportation preferences**: Flights, trains, car rental, local transit
- **Past travel experience**: Destinations visited, what they loved/disliked
- **Must-see vs nice-to-have**: Priorities and deal-breakers
- **Dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, pet travel**

## 3. Information Sources for Trip Planning
Where do professional trip designers find quality information?
- Review sites (TripAdvisor, Google Reviews, Yelp)
- Travel blogs and influencers
- Local tourism boards
- Hotel/airline direct sources
- Real-time event calendars
- Weather services
- Safety/travel advisories
- Local news for events/closures
- Pricing aggregators (Google Flights, Kayak, Rome2Rio)

## 4. Web Search Strategy
What queries should a trip designer make?
- When to search (missing info, validation, pricing)
- Query formulation patterns
- How to validate information freshness
- Combining multiple sources

## 5. Structured Decision Points
What are common decision points where users should choose from options?
- Destination selection
- Hotel tier selection  
- Activity type preferences
- Dining style preferences
- Transportation mode choices

## 6. Session Flow Patterns
How should a trip designer conversation flow?
- Initial discovery phase
- Destination research phase
- Itinerary building phase
- Refinement phase
- Finalization phase

Please provide actionable findings that can inform the design of an AI Trip Designer agent. Include specific example questions and decision trees where helpful.
