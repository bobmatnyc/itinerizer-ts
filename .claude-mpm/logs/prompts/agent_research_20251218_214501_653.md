# Agent Memory: research
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-12-18T03:23:48.469258+00:00Z -->



INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Research the technical integration requirements for building a Trip Designer agent with:

## 1. OpenRouter Web Search Integration
- How does OpenRouter's web search work with LLM calls?
- What models support web search on OpenRouter?
- API patterns for enabling web search
- Cost considerations
- Response format with search results

## 2. SERP API for Travel Pricing
Research SERP APIs that can provide:
- Flight pricing and routes
- Hotel pricing
- Train/bus routes and pricing (Rome2Rio style)
- Transfer services (taxi, shuttle estimates)
- Car rental pricing

Look at:
- SerpAPI (serpapi.com)
- Google Flights API alternatives
- Skyscanner API
- Rome2Rio API
- Any free/affordable options

## 3. High-Thinking LLM Options for Tool Calling
Compare models for trip planning agent:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Opus via OpenRouter
- GPT-4o/GPT-4-turbo via OpenRouter
- Tool calling capabilities
- Context window sizes
- Cost per token
- Streaming support

## 4. Session Compaction Strategies
How to maintain long conversations without hitting context limits:
- Summarization approaches
- Key information extraction
- Rolling context windows
- What to preserve vs compress

## 5. Real-time Document Updates
Patterns for:
- Agent updating a JSON document during conversation
- Streaming partial updates to UI
- Conflict resolution if user edits during agent work

Provide specific API endpoints, code patterns, and configuration needed for implementation.
