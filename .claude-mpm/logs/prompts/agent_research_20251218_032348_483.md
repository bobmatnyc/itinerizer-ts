Investigate the current segment types and structure in the itinerizer-ts project. I need to understand:

1. The current Segment type definition (look in src/domain/types/)
2. How segments are currently structured (what fields exist for time, date, location)
3. The different segment types (FLIGHT, HOTEL, ACTIVITY, TRANSFER, etc.)
4. How the LLM parses segments currently
5. Any existing location/time validation

This is research only - don't make any changes. Report back with:
- Current segment type definition
- What fields exist for temporal data (start/end times)
- What fields exist for geographic data (locations)
- Gaps that need to be filled for semantic segments

The user wants to implement:
- Defined start and end time/date for each segment
- Defined start and end geographic location for each segment
- Auto-generate transfer segments when adjacent segments have different end/start locations
