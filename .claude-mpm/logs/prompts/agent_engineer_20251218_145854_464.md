INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Improve the Svelte dashboard at `/Users/masa/Projects/itinerizer-ts/viewer-svelte/` to have a more elegant, polished, modern design.

**Current State:**
- Dashboard has basic Tailwind CSS styling
- User says it looks "pretty rough" and wants something more elegant
- Components: StatsCard, ItineraryCard, ItineraryList, ItineraryDetail

**Design Requirements:**
1. **Modern, clean aesthetic** - Think Linear, Notion, or Vercel dashboard style
2. **Subtle gradients and shadows** - Softer, more refined look
3. **Better typography** - Use font-weight variations, better spacing
4. **Polished cards** - Refined borders, subtle hover animations, better visual hierarchy
5. **Consistent color palette** - Professional blues/grays with accent colors
6. **Smooth transitions** - Hover effects, focus states

**Files to Update:**
- `src/app.css` - Global styles, CSS variables for theming
- `src/lib/components/StatsCard.svelte` - Elegant stat cards with icons
- `src/lib/components/ItineraryCard.svelte` - Polished itinerary cards
- `src/lib/components/ItineraryList.svelte` - Grid layout refinements
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Overall layout improvements

**Inspiration:**
- Use subtle gradients (like `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-50`)
- Add backdrop blur effects where appropriate
- Use ring/outline styles for focus states
- Consider adding subtle patterns or textures
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming

**Keep Working:**
- All existing functionality (data fetching, modals, clicks)
- Dark mode support
- Responsive grid layout

Return the updated files and confirm the dashboard looks more polished and professional.
